        <h1> <i> NOTICE </i> </h1>
        This is just a website we just created, didn't had a idea tbh ok cool cool. Although if this bad and poorly website were to be in the top 10, it would be extremely crazy, so yeah. Anyways this is just our opinion, so no one has to take this seriously and if this doesn't get accepted then its fine. Anyways this website was supposed to be about some topic, but this is now just about how 3 dumb kids(one of them is me) created this website in under 2 hours. tbh it is pretty impressive we made this in less than 2 hours. ALSO <b> This is not a real show. Again Don't Take this seriously. Have a nice day and enjoy looking at this I guess.

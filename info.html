            <p>Mike is a red sphere who lives in Tonshed, he is brave and always is the defender instead of the defended. However, he is always looking for trouble, if he wasn't busy with adventure, he'd be off trying to create it. He always is a troublemaker and likes to either join in trouble or to create it, and he is always protrayed as a good guy by defeating the bad guy. He carries a sword and shield into battle.</p>
